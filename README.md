# Telecom Churn Prediction - in progress
> Objectives
 The main goal of this case study is to develop machine learning models for predicting churn. The predictive models have the following purposes:

 - Predicting whether a high-value customer is likely to churn in the near future (i.e., churn phase). This information can assist the company in taking proactive measures such as offering special plans or discounts on recharge to retain customers.

 - Identifying significant variables that strongly indicate churn. These variables can provide insights into the reasons why customers choose to switch to other networks.

 Based on observations, strategies for managing customer churn are recommended.
