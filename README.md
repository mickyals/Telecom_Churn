# Telecom Churn Prediction - in progress
> Problem Statement
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate.
Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business
goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

In this competition, your goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.

> Objectives
 The main goal of this case study is to develop machine learning models for predicting churn. The predictive models have the following purposes:

 - Predicting whether a high-value customer is likely to churn in the near future (i.e., churn phase). This information can assist the company in taking proactive measures such as offering special plans or discounts on recharge to retain customers.

 - Identifying significant variables that strongly indicate churn. These variables can provide insights into the reasons why customers choose to switch to other networks.

 Based on observations, strategies for managing customer churn are recommended.
